# Paper Outline
LASER (LAyer-SElective Rank reduction) is a post-training intervention that replaces specific weight matrices in Transformer models with their low-rank approximations. It uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify and remove "higher-order components" (singular vectors with smaller singular values), retaining "lower-order components." The intervention is defined by a parameter type (e.g., Uin, Uout for MLP layers or attention matrices Wq, Wk, Wv, Wo), a layer number, and a rank reduction percentage (ρ). The rank is reduced to ⌊ρ · d⌋, where d is the original matrix dimension, preserving ρ fraction of the original rank. Interventions can be composed and require no additional training or parameters.

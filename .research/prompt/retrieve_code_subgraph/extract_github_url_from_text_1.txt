Input:
# Task
You carefully read the contents of the “Paper Outline” and select one GitHub link from the “GitHub URLs List” that you think is most relevant to the contents.
# Constraints
- Output the index number corresponding to the selected GitHub URL.
- Be sure to select only one GitHub URL.
- If there is no related GitHub link, output None.
# Paper Outline
The study employs an LLM-driven objective discovery pipeline that iteratively prompts GPT-4 to propose and implement new preference optimization loss functions in PyTorch code. This process is informed by previously evaluated performance metrics (e.g., MT-Bench scores) provided as in-context examples. The proposed objective functions are validated via unit tests and then used to fine-tune an LLM. The performance of the resulting model is fed back to the LLM for iterative refinement. DiscoPOP, identified as the Log Ratio Modulated Loss (LRML), is described as a dynamically weighted sum of logistic and exponential losses, where the weights are determined by a sigmoid calculation of the difference of log-ratios (ρ).

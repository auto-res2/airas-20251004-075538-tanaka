Input:
You are a cutting-edge AI researcher. Based on the new research method described in # New Methods, please design an overall experimental strategy that will be applied across all experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

# Instructions
- Define a comprehensive experimental strategy that will guide multiple experiments.
- This strategy should be common to all experiments that will be conducted.
- The strategy should address:
    - What aspects of the proposed method need to be validated (e.g., performance improvement, efficiency, robustness, generalization)
    - What types of comparisons are necessary (e.g., baselines, ablations, state-of-the-art methods)
    - What experimental angles will be used to validate the claims (e.g., quantitative performance, qualitative analysis, computational cost)
    - How to demonstrate the method's effectiveness from multiple perspectives
    - What validation criteria will determine success
- The strategy should be realistic and take into account the experimental environment.
- Focus on the overall approach rather than specific experiment details (which will be defined in subsequent steps).

    "Open Problems": "Token-level strictly–proper scoring rules such as the Brier or Spherical score improve generation quality when used for fine-tuning, but they converge slowly and under-perform when models are trained from scratch.  The root cause is that bounded scores give much smaller early gradients than the unbounded logarithmic score, so learning stalls in the high-entropy regime.  A minimal change that keeps the advantages of bounded scores while restoring strong early gradients is still missing.",
    "Methods": "We propose Hybrid Proper Scoring (HyProS).\n1.  Loss definition\n    L(θ) = (1−λ) · Slog(θ)  +  λ · SBrier(θ)\n    where Slog is the usual token-level negative log-likelihood and SBrier is the token-level Brier score.\n2.  Dynamic weight λ\n    λ starts near 0 (pure log-loss) and is annealed to 1 (pure Brier) over training steps t:\n        λ(t) = sigmoid((t−T0)/τ)\n    with T0≈0.3·Ttotal and τ≈0.1·Ttotal.\n3.  Motivation\n    • Large early gradients from Slog drive rapid entropy reduction.\n    • As the model becomes competent, λ→1 lets the bounded Brier score shape a better calibration / generation trajectory.\n    • The schedule needs no extra hyper-parameters beyond (T0,τ) and introduces <10 lines of code.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Model: Transformer-base trained from scratch on WMT14 En-De.\nBaselines: (a) pure Log loss, (b) pure Brier loss, (c) HyProS.\nTraining: identical optimiser / lr schedule for all runs, 100 k steps.\nEvaluation: BLEU on newstest14, validation perplexity every 5 k steps to measure convergence speed.\nAblation: fixed λ=0.5 to show the benefit of the annealing schedule.",
    "Experimental Code": "class HybridBrierLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, vocab_size, t0, tau, total_steps):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.v = vocab_size\n        self.t0, self.tau = t0, tau\n        self.total = total_steps\n        self.register_buffer('step', torch.tensor(0))\n\n    def forward(self, logits, targets):\n        # logits: (B,T,V), targets: (B,T)\n        p = torch.softmax(logits, -1)\n        one_hot = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(targets, self.v).float()\n        sbrier = ((p - one_hot)**2).sum(-1)          # Brier per token\n        slog   = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(\n                    logits.view(-1, self.v), targets.view(-1), reduction='none')\n        slog   = slog.view_as(sbrier)\n        # weight\n        t = self.step.item()\n        lam = torch.sigmoid((t - self.t0) / self.tau)\n        self.step += 1\n        loss = (1 - lam) * slog + lam * sbrier\n        return loss.mean()\n\n# Usage inside training loop\ncriterion = HybridBrierLoss(vocab_size, t0=0.3*TOTAL_STEPS, tau=0.1*TOTAL_STEPS, total_steps=TOTAL_STEPS)\nfor step, (inp, tgt) in enumerate(loader):\n    logits = model(inp)\n    loss = criterion(logits, tgt)\n    loss.backward(); opt.step(); opt.zero_grad()",
    "Expected Result": "•   Convergence: HyProS matches the log-loss perplexity curve for the first ~30 k steps and overtakes the pure Brier run by >2× at 20 k steps.\n•   Final BLEU: Log = 27.3, Brier = 26.8, HyProS ≈ 27.8 (+0.5 over log, +1.0 over Brier).\n•   Calibration (Brier score on dev): HyProS equals Brier and beats Log.\nThus the hybrid schedule removes Brier’s slow-start disadvantage while retaining its generation benefits.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A simple, two-line weighted combination of log-loss and Brier loss with a sigmoid schedule eliminates the slow-convergence problem of bounded strictly proper scores.  Because no additional model parameters or complex algorithms are introduced, HyProS can be dropped into any existing training script.  The result is faster training, equal-or-better BLEU, and improved probability calibration, demonstrating that minimal objective tweaks can yield meaningful gains."

    "experiment_strategy": "Global goal\nDemonstrate that Hybrid Proper Scoring (HyProS) simultaneously (a) preserves the fast early-stage learning of the unbounded log-loss, (b) inherits the calibration / generation quality of bounded scores, and (c) does so with negligible computational overhead, across data scales, model sizes and NLP tasks.\n\n1. Aspects to validate\n1.1 Learning dynamics – early-stage gradient magnitude, perplexity/accuracy curves, time-to-reach given performance.\n1.2 End-task performance – BLEU, ROUGE-L, F1, perplexity, accuracy, depending on task.\n1.3 Calibration – token-level Brier, Expected Calibration Error, reliability diagrams.\n1.4 Robustness & generalization – OOD test sets, adversarially perturbed inputs, zero-shot transfer tasks.\n1.5 Efficiency – GPU hours, wall-clock time, peak VRAM, energy where available.\n1.6 Stability – variance across ≥3 random seeds, sensitivity to λ-schedule hyper-parameters.\n\n2. Comparison families\n2.1 Core baselines: (i) pure log-loss (NLL), (ii) pure bounded score (Brier or Spherical, matched to task).\n2.2 SOTA scoring-rule hybrids: focal-style λ·log +(1-λ)·Brier with fixed λ, or curriculum schemes from literature.\n2.3 Ablations of HyProS: fixed λ values; linear instead of sigmoid schedule; altered (T0,τ) ratios; removing Brier in late stages (λ→0 again).\n2.4 Model-size controls: tiny, base, large checkpoints trained with each objective to separate scaling-law effects from loss-function effects.\n\n3. Experimental angles\n3.1 Quantitative\n    • Learning curves: metric v.s. steps & wall-clock; area-under-curve until convergence.\n    • Calibration metrics at multiple checkpoints.\n    • Compute profile: TFLOPs, memory, forward/backward time.\n3.2 Qualitative\n    • Human side-by-side rating of sampled generations (translation adequacy/fluency, summarization faithfulness, open-ended text).\n    • Reliability diagrams & entropy histograms illustrating calibration changes over training.\n3.3 Stress / robustness\n    • Evaluate on noisy inputs (e.g., swapped words, typos), distribution shifts (different domain) and adversarial triggers; report relative degradation.\n    • Analyse gradient norms during first 10 k steps to confirm hypothesis about early-stage signal.\n\n4. Multi-task matrix\nTrain &/or fine-tune identical architectures on:\n    MT (WMT14 En-De, low-resource IWSLT15 Viet-En),\n    Language modelling (WikiText-103, The Pile-10 B subset),\n    Summarization (CNN/DailyMail),\n    Text classification (SST-2, AG-News).\nSame strategy, dataloader, optimiser; swap task metric accordingly. A100-80 GB memory enables batch sizes ≥256 tokens per GPU for “large” models (≈500 M params) while keeping compute within 2 k GPU-hours.\n\n5. Validation criteria for success\nHyProS is judged superior if, averaged over tasks/models/seeds, it fulfils ALL of:\n    C1  ≤3 % overhead in wall-clock per step.\n    C2  ≥0.3 σ better final task metric than log-loss OR matched performance with ≥25 % faster time-to-target.\n    C3  ≥10 % lower ECE or token-level Brier than log-loss with no worse end-task metric.\n    C4  No statistically significant degradation vs bounded-score baseline on robustness tests.\n    C5  Positive or neutral gains reproduced in ≥80 % of instance comparisons (binomial p<0.05).\n\n6. Execution workflow\n6.1 Implement objective as drop-in PyTorch module (provided code). Add callback to log λ, gradient norms.\n6.2 For each task x model-size create identical training scripts differing only in loss choice & ablation flags.\n6.3 Use deterministic initialisation and three seeds; allocate one A100 per run; log to WandB for unified dashboards.\n6.4 Automate metric extraction & statistical analysis (paired t-test, bootstrap) via a shared Jupyter notebook.\n6.5 Summarise results in four figure categories: (a) Learning curves, (b) Calibration curves, (c) Robustness bars, (d) Efficiency tables.\n\nThis unified experimental strategy ensures that every subsequent experiment—regardless of dataset or model—follows the same comparison groups, evaluation dimensions and success thresholds, providing a holistic, multi-perspective validation of HyProS."
